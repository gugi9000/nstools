# nstools
shorthand tools for most common uses of nslookup

Basically just a collection of CMD-scripts for easier NSLOOKUPs.

I often have look up using a public DNS and not the interal ones at work.

## Example:
Instead of something like this:
```
nslookup -q=MX example.com 141.1.1.1
```
I just: 
```
mx example.com
```

and so on..
